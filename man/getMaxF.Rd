\title{Maximum viable fisheries effort for species}
\usage{
getMaxF(
  params,
  idx_species,
  effort_it = 1,
  distance_func = distanceSSLogN,
  tol = 0.001,
  max_func = maxFthreshold,
  threshold_var = 10,
  t_max = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{An object of class \code{MizerParams}.}

\item{idx_species}{TODO: document}

\item{effort_it}{The width of steps used to find maximum fisheries mortality,
higher values means a faster calculation but less accurate maximum.}

\item{distance_func}{A function that will be called after every \code{t_per} years
with both the previous and the new state and that should return a number
that in some sense measures the distance between the states. By default
this uses the function \code{\link[=distanceSSLogN]{distanceSSLogN()}} that you can use as a model for your
own distance function.}

\item{tol}{The \code{projectToSteady} function stops when the relative change in the egg production
RDI over t_per years is less than tol for every species.}

\item{max_func}{A function used in \code{getMaxF} to determines the threshold to use
when stopping the fisheries effort.}

\item{threshold_var}{A numeric value used in max_func to calculate the threshold
from the \code{params} object. If supplied, the function returns the value of the
threshold using \code{threshold_var}. If not supplied, the function returns the
unchanged value, which can be compared against the version which uses \code{threshold_var}.}

\item{t_max}{The longest time to run project to find steady state.}

\description{
Calculate the maximum fisheries effort before reaching a specific threshold
Default case is biomass exposed to fisheries lower than 10\% of original biomass
