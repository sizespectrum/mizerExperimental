\title{Calculates yield from steady sim}
\usage{
yieldCalculator(
  params,
  effort_vec,
  idx_species,
  distance_func = distanceSSLogN,
  tol = 0.001,
  t_max = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{An object of class \code{MizerParams}.}

\item{distance_func}{A function that will be called after every \code{t_per} years
with both the previous and the new state and that should return a number
that in some sense measures the distance between the states. By default
this uses the function \code{\link[=distanceSSLogN]{distanceSSLogN()}} that you can use as a model for your
own distance function.}

\item{tol}{The \code{projectToSteady} function stops when the relative change in the egg production
RDI over t_per years is less than tol for every species.}

\item{t_max}{The longest time to run project to find steady state.}
}
\value{
a vector of yield value of same length as \code{effort_vec}
}
\description{
This function replaces a loop used multiple times within
\code{getYieldVsCurve}
}
