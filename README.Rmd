# mizerExperimental

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an extension package for the mizer package
(https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/) that contains additional features contributed
by the mizer community. These features can then be further improved while being
used by the community. Once matured, frequently-used features can be moved to
the core mizer package.

If you have code for working with mizer that you feel might be useful to other
mizer users, please describe it in [a new issue on the issue
tracker](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizerExperimental/issues/new) and we'll
comment on how it can be included in this package.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of mizerStarvation from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
