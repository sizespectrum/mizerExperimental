# Show two size spectra in the same plot

Show two size spectra in the same plot

## Usage

``` r
plotSpectra2(
  object1,
  object2,
  name1 = "First",
  name2 = "Second",
  power = 1,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- object1:

  First MizerParams or MizerSim object.

- object2:

  Second MizerParams or MizerSim object.

- name1:

  An optional string with the name for the first model, to be used in
  the legend. Set to "First" by default.

- name2:

  An optional string with the name for the second model, to be used in
  the legend. Set to "Second" by default.

- power:

  The abundance is plotted as the number density times the weight raised
  to this power. The default power = 1 gives the biomass density,
  whereas power = 2 gives the biomass density with respect to
  logarithmic size bins.

- ...:

  Parameters to pass to `plotSpectra()`

## Value

A ggplot2 object

## Examples

``` r
sim1 <- project(NS_params, t_max = 10)
sim2 <- project(NS_params, effort = 0.5, t_max = 10)
plotSpectra2(sim1, sim2, "Original", "Effort = 0.5")
```
