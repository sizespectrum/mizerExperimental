# The following is a copy of the code for `matchBiomasses()` just with
# the text replacements "Biomass" -> "Number" and "biomass" to "number" and
# the removal of the `params@w` factor in the calculations.

#' Match numbers to observations
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#' The function adjusts the numbers of the species in the model so that their numbers
#' match with observations.
#'
#' The function works by multiplying for each species the number density
#' at all sizes by the same factor. This will of course not give a steady
#' state solution, even if the initial number densities were at steady state.
#' So after using this function you may want to use `steady()` to run the model
#' to steady state, after which of course the numbers will no longer match
#' exactly. You could then iterate this process. This is described in the
#' blog post at https://bit.ly/2YqXESV.
#'
#' Before you can use this function you will need to have added a
#' `number_observed` column to your model which gives the observed number in
#' grams.  For species for which you have no observed number, you should set
#' the value in the `number_observed` column to 0 or NA.
#'
#' Number observations usually only include individuals above a certain size.
#' This size should be specified in a `number_cutoff` column of the species
#' parameter data frame. If this is missing, it is assumed that all sizes are
#' included in the observed number, i.e., it includes larval number.
#'
#' @param params A MizerParams object
#' @param species The species to be affected. Optional. By default all observed
#'   numbers will be matched. A vector of species names, or a numeric vector
#'   with the species indices, or a logical vector indicating for each species
#'   whether it is to be affected (TRUE) or not.
